# Motion analysis based on 2D image processing
Repo includes a Matlab script for 1D motion analysis based on image processing.
Script was used for calculating position, velocity and acceleration of an object in motion. Data was extracted through image processing obtained from a speed camera. The minimum eigenvalue algorithm was used for object tracking.
In order to run the script Matlab with Computer Vision Toolbox is required.
*Script originally created to test an adaptive air cushion.

Hope it helps, and have fun!
